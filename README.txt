This robot was built for a class I had called Foundations of Engineering Lab.
The project was to build a robot that could act as educational material for elementary to middle school aged students. I was responsible for the software engineering portion of the robot, as well as building the circuitry. We as a group wrote a technical report that summed up our findings and development process. 
The functionality of the robot is as follows: Upon initializing, the robot lowers a crane arm, moves forward, and then lifts up the arm, attempting to pick up a small object such as a cardboard box. Then, it keeps an appropriate distance from a nearby object that it will follow, such as a hand. If the hand is too far, it moves forward. If the hand is too close, it will move backwards. If the distance is just right, it does not move. However, if there is no object for the robot to find, it will rotate, looking for the object in case it has moved to the side. If the robot stayed in the same position and orientation for 10 seconds, it will drop the object by lowering the crane arm and enter an idle state until initialized again.
Code has been made into functional blocks purposefully to ensure easy reprogramming as an educational tool.
